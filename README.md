# Poetry Finder

An AI-powered classical poetry search tool that uses semantic understanding to find the most relevant poems from PoetryDB's collection based on themes and sentiments.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Semantic Search** - Uses TensorFlow.js Universal Sentence Encoder to understand the meaning of your query, not just keywords
- üìö **Thousands of Classic Poems** - Searches PoetryDB's extensive collection of public domain poetry
- üé® **Classical Design** - Beautiful, ornamental UI inspired by antique poetry books
- ‚ö° **Fast & Free** - Runs entirely in the browser, no backend required

## How It Works

1. Enter a theme or sentiment (e.g., "burden of leadership", "heartbreak", "nature")
2. The app extracts keywords and searches PoetryDB's API
3. AI ranks results by semantic relevance to your query
4. Displays the most thematically relevant poem in full

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js + Universal Sentence Encoder
- **API**: PoetryDB (public domain poetry database)
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Crimson Text)
